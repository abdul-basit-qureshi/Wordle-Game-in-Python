# Wordle-Game-in-Python
Welcome to the Wordle game in Python! This is a text-based version of the classic Wordle game. The game's objective is to guess a five-letter word in a maximum of six tries. After each guess, you will receive feedback on each letter's position in the word.

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script to start the game.<br>
2. The program will generate a random five-letter word as the solution.<br>
3. Enter your guess for the word and press Enter.<br>
4. After each guess, you will receive feedback on each letter:
* '*' (question mark) indicates the letter is in the correct position.
* '?' (asterisk) indicates the letter is present in the solution but in the wrong position.
* '-' (hyphen) indicates the letter is not present in the solution. 
<br>
5. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the word or reach the maximum of six tries.<br>
6. Once the game ends, you can choose to play again or exit the game.
